## Conventions

- `dot_`: dotfiles in the home directory
- `private_`: files that need private permissions
- `executable_`: files that need the executable bit
- `.tmpl`: templates for machine-specific values or secret injection

Do not use templates for static configuration.

Do not commit secrets, tokens, or private keys.
